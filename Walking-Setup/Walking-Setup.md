# Walking Setup

The following components can be used on an experimental setup for walking flies, sometimes known as a "treadmill setup." The majority of the components were created for the ["Inexpensive Treadmill"]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill) paper. We've also begun collecting pieces for [flight]({{site.baseurl}}/flight) and [physiological]({{site.baseurl}}/physiology) configurations, and there may be some overlap. Fly-tethering related components are listed under the [Tethering]({{site.baseurl}}/tether) menu, while additional components and 3D models are presented under [Miscellaneous]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous).

## [Inexpensive Treadmill Assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/inexpensive-treadmill)

Different components combined to a functional experimental setup. We use this assembly to produce the figures for the publication on the [Inexpensive Treadmill setup]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill).

## [Sphere holder (Treadmill)]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/sphere-holder)

[![Sphere holder with 90Â° inlet]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Treadmill_Sphere_Holder/Treadmill_Sphere_Holder_9mm-ball_90deg.png){: .ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/sphere-holder)
Spherical insect treadmills are essentially small spheres floating in air. A sphere holder is the component that holds the sphere in a specific location and contains an air intake for pressurized air and an outlet where the sphere would be situated.

## [Illumination]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/illumination)

[![Set of lamps]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Lamp_LED_5mm/illumination-lamps.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/illumination)
Optical tracking of spherical treadmills, for example through [FicTrac](https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac), requires good illumination.

## [Stands]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/stands)

[![Manipulator Stand]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Stands/Stand_Treadmill_Sphere_Holder.png){: .ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/stands)
To assemble different components at specific locations, we use different stands. Examples include camera stands, Micromanipulator stands, and spherical holder stands that are easy, but stable, to build.
