# Walking Setup

Components listed here can be used on an experimental setup or are otherwise directly in contact with experiment.

## [Inexpensive Treadmill Assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/inexpensive-treadmill)
{:.clear}
[![Inexpensive Setup assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Inexpensive-Treadmill_Assembly/Inexpensive-Treadmill_Assembly.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/inexpensive-treadmill)
Different components combined to a functional experimental setup. We use this assembly to produce the figures for the publication on the [Inexpensive Treadmill setup]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill).

## [Sphere holder (Treadmill)]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/sphere-holder)

[![Sphere holder with 90Â° inlet]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Treadmill_Sphere_Holder/Treadmill_Sphere_Holder_9mm-ball_90deg.png){: .ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/sphere-holder)
Spherical treadmills for insects are essentially small sphere floating on air. A sphere holder is the component that holds the sphere in a defined place, so it has an air inlet and an air outlet where the sphere would be placed.

## [Illumination]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/illumination)
{:.clear}

[![Set of lamps]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Lamp_LED_5mm/illumination-lamps.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/illumination)
Optical tracking of spherical treadmills, for example through [FicTrac](https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac), requires good illumination. 

## [Stands]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/stands)
{:.clear}

[![Manipulator Stand]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Stands/Stand_Treadmill_Sphere_Holder.png){: .ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/stands)
To assemble different components at specific locations, we use different stands. For example we designed simple but stable stands for the camera, for Micromanipulators, and for the sphere holder.

## [Wells]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/wells)
{:.clear}

[![Square Wells]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Walking-Setup/Square_wells_90mm/Wells_3x3_optogenetics.png){: .ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/wells)
Wells or small arenas are confined areas, usually used for single-fly behavioral experiments sometimes with optogentic stimulation. Responses are typically filmed and analyzed through video tracking. 

## [Wingbeat analyzer masks]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/wba-masks)
{:.clear}

# Scrapbook

These parts are not finished yet, but might be useful to some in the future.

## [Magnetic robot arm holder]({{site.baseurl}}/walking/magnet-holder)
