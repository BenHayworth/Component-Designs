# Flyplate 5

The [Flyplate5](production/Flyplate5.stl) was designed at [Janelia Experimental Technology (jET)](https://www.janelia.org/support-team/janelia-experimental-technology) and is the 5th iteration of the design. For this design, the head of the fly is glued to the tip of the cone on one side of the plate. After glueing the fly, it is possible to dissect parts of the head, i.e. for patch clamping and brain imaging. The inner part of the cone tends to be filled with liquid that provides nutrients to the animal and can be imaged through. The upper part of the cone is big enough for a microscope lens to be lowered into the liquid. The other end of the plate can be fixed to a kinematic base (eg [Thorlabs KBT1X1](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=KBT1X1)) to easily mount it either at the tethering station, imaging rig, or experimental setup.

`Flyplate5.ipt`: The design file is in a proprietary file format. The additional `step` file should allow basic modifications. We have successfully printed the supplied `stl` file.

Initially the design was machined according to the specification in the design files. The result is very sturdy and can be re-used many times. The following images shows a detail of the machined Fly Plate after having been used many times.

We recently started to see if 3D printing could work as well. So far, we have not run experiments with it, but the same detail of the flyplate looks very similar. This flyplate was printed on the [Connex]({{site.baseurl}}/production) printer.
