# Fly Pyramid Print

The "Fly Pyramid Print" is a accessory we use in preparations for electro physiology experiments with Drosophila melanogaster. This version is [printable on an inexpensive 3D printer]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-print-a-fly-pyramid) with material costs of <$0.50 per piece. The design is based on a previously machined version made from PEEK plastic that had been in use in the lab for many years.

Drosophila come in different sizes, so our "Fly Pyramid Print" also comes in two sizes for now: size "S" (pictured on the right) and "XS". The difference is the size of the hole where the head is fixed to and is based on the experience with fly sizes in our lab. Both of our pyramids come in a printing stack of 3 and already with support (shown in orange). If you want to print more than 3, we describe that in our [step-by-step guide]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-print-a-fly-pyramid).

We provide `*.step` files for both sizes and you will also find the `*.stl` files inside the `production/` folder. The `*.stl` files are in mm, a batch of 3 should be roughly 13×60×30mm³ in size. More about file sizes in our [File types and software]({{site.baseurl}}/file-types) section.

If you have questions or need anything else, then please [get in contact]({{site.baseurl}}/about).
