# Physiology

Components such as the head fixation plate mentioned below can be utilized for physiology research and may be beneficial for both the [walking]({{site.baseurl}}/walking) and [flight]({{site.baseurl}}/flight) setups. Tethering-related components are listed under the [Tethering]({{site.baseurl}}/tether) menu, while additional components and 3D models are presented under [Miscellaneous]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous).

## [Flyplate]({{site.baseurl}}/physiology/flyplate)

The flyplate is used primarily in 2-photon imaging experiments. The fly head is glued to the plate, which allows dissecting and imaging in head-fixed experiments.

## [Fly Pyramid]({{site.baseurl}}/physiology/flypyramid)

We use the Fly Pyramid in electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings with head-fixed flies. Compared to the Flyplate, the wider working area gives more access to the head for dissections and provides more stability during the manipulations.
