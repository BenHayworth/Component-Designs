# Flight Setup

Components listed here can be used on an experimental setup for flying flies. 

We intend to build a collection comparable to the [walking setup]({{site.baseurl}}/walking) over time. Tethering-related components are listed under the [Tethering]({{site.baseurl}}/tether) menu, while other components and 3D models are shown under [Miscellaneous]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous). The components used in [physiological experiments]({{site.baseurl}}/physiology) are discussed elsewhere.

These parts are not finished yet, but might be useful to some in the future.
