# Flight Setup

Components listed here can be used on an experimental setup for flying flies. Over time we plan to have a collection similar to the [walking setup](/walking). Components related to fly tethering are listed under the [Tethering](/tether) menu, with additional components and 3D models under [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous). Parts used in [physiology setups](/physiology) are mentioned elsewhere.
