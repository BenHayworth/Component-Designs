# Illumination

The rotation of the spherical treadmill we use in the article about an inexpensive setup is optically tracked through a camera. We use near infrared (NIR) illumination on the sphere since fly vision is insensitive to longer wavelengths while many camera sensors can measure it well. In our setup we use several 840nm LEDs placed between the camera and sphere, pointing at the sphere. The current lamp shade design reduces direct light from the LEDs to the camera sensor. Together with the posts which friction mount in the base plate, the light can be finely adjusted to the sphere. We can also add light diffusers in front of the lamp shade to get a more even illumination of the scene. We provide lamp posts in different lengths, but they can easily be adjusted.

The lamp posts are hollow to reduce the amount of material needed for printing, but also to guide the cables to the LEDs.
