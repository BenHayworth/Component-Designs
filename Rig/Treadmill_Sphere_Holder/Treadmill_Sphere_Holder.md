# Holder for Fly Treadmill

All three versions of the "Holder Treadmill Barb" need to be printed on a high density printer to avoid air leaks. We produced our samples on the [connex](../README.md) (see Manufacturing in top-level README).

The initial version [Holder_Treadmill_Barb-adapter_straight](Holder_Treadmill_Barb-adapter_straight.stl) worked fine, but required the connector to be fixed below the holder. This limits how  the holder can be positioned. The one-armed version is a variance of that design that allows more flexible positioning, requires less space, and is cheaper in production. At the same time its more difficult to fixate. The material at the screw mount holes was so thin that it would break upon forceful fixation.

[Holder_Treadmill_Barb-adapter](Holder_Treadmill_Barb-adapter.stl) is an improvement, as it is generally more sturdy. Furthermore the hose is attached in a 90Â° angle to the direction of the airflow output. In setups with a base plate, it can be positioned much closer to that ground level.
