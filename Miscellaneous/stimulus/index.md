# Stimulus presentation

This is a hidden site with some examples for possible visual stimluli. 

I have previously shown the virtual arena from the perspective of the fly, with [10° bars rotating](01_rotation.html) around the fly.

Each bar can be modified independently, eg by assigning [different contrasts](02_contrast.html), [different colors](03_colors.html), splitting the bars into sub-bars [moving in different directions](04_colors_movement.html).

There are different ways to think about stimulis creation: You can think about the location of the bar on the virtual cylinder. In this examle, you can use the modifiers in the upper right corner to [position and modify the bar](07_bar.html). At the moment, the numbers are arbitrary units, but once a system is calibrated to a specific screen size and distance from the fly, you could replace these numbers by "-10° to -12° vertically, and -5° to 25° horizontally" or whatever is the best unit for your experiment.

The only thing that really needs calibration, are the settings of the virtual [Camera](06_Camera.html) (use modifier in the uupper right corner to change zoom and field of view).

Another way to think about stimulus construction, is placement in 3D. For example, you could have an [inner and outer arena](05_inner_outer.html) rotating in opposing directions.

While all of the above stimuli have a stationary fly / camera, you could also virtually [move the fly ](08_obstacles.html).

Here again the (same) demos as a list:

1. [10° bars rotating](01_rotation.html)
1. [different contrasts](02_contrast.html)
1. [different colors](03_colors.html)
1. [moving in different directions](04_colors_movement.html)
1. [position and modify the bar](07_bar.html)
1. [Camera](06_Camera.html)
1. [inner and outer arena](05_inner_outer.html)
1. [move the fly ](08_obstacles.html)
