# Miscellaneous

These files are either models of existing hardware that we use for visualization, or some supporting components that can be used in different contexts. Files in this section include models of the tablet and camera used in the ["Inexpensive Treadmill"](/inexpensive-treadmill), a local copy of an external three-axis manipulator, cases for MCUs, or the scale bar used only for visualizations.

## [Scale bar]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/scale-bar)
{:.clear}

[![Model of a 20mm scale bar]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Miscellaneous/Scale-Bar/Scale-Bar.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/scale-bar)
A FreeCAD model of a scale bar that can be used in assemblies. We also used it as approximations in photos of components. It doesn't really make sense to produce it.

## [Tablet]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/tablet)
{:.clear}

[![Model of a 7" tablet]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Miscellaneous/Tablet/FireTablet.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/tablet)
A FreeCAD model of an existing tablet, the Amazon Fire  7". The model can be used in visualizations.

## [PS3 Eye]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/ps3-eye)
{:.clear}

[![Model of the PS3 Eye camera]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Miscellaneous/PS3-Eye/PS3-Eye.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/ps3-eye)
FreeCAD model of the Playstation 3 Eye camera, which we used in our [Inexpensive Treadmill setup]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill). Potentially useful in visualizations.

## [Dispensing Needle]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/dispensing-needle)
{:.clear}

[![Model of the dispensing needle with Luer lock]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Miscellaneous/Luer-Tether/Luer-Tether.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/miscellaneous/dispensing-needle)
FreeCAD model of a blunt tip dispensing need we use in our setup. Useful in visualizations.
