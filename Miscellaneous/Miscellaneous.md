# Miscellaneous

These files are not necessarily parts to be used and produced, but placeholders in constructions and assemblies. This could be a model of the tablet, a camera, or the scale bar.

A FreeCAD model of a scale bar that can be used in assemblies. We also used it as approximations in photos of components. It doesn't really make sense to produce it.
