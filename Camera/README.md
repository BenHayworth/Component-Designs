## PS3 lens mount M12

This is the lens mount that can be used for an M12 lense on a PS3 Eye PCB. Glueing this directly on the PCB after taking apart the camera allows the use of standard M12 lenses while protecting the sensor. It also fits inside the outer body of the PS3 eye.


## Case_Camera_Basler

This is the back side of a case for a small board camera. It includes a 90Â° screw hole. Designed by Igor Nagrashov at [jET](https://www.janelia.org/support-team/janelia-experimental-technology).

Certain files couldn't be opened (`ipt`, `obj`; content unknown). Printing of `stl` worked fine. `FCStd` file is an attempt to import the `stl` file, but doesn't allow detailed editing.
