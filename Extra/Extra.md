# Extras

These files are not necessarily parts to be used and produced, but placeholders in constructions and assemblies. This could be a model of the tablet, a camera, or the scale bar.

## [Scale bar](/extra/scale-bar)
{:.clear}

[![Model of a 20mm scale bar]({{"/assets/img/Extra/Scale-Bar/Scale-Bar.png"|relative_url}}){:.ifr}](/extra/scale-bar)
A FreeCAD model of a scale bar that can be used in assemblies. We also used it as approximations in photos of components. It doesn't really make sense to produce it.

## [Tablet](/extra/tablet)
{:.clear}

[![Model of a 7" tablet]({{"/assets/img/Extra/Tablet/FireTablet.png"|relative_url}}){:.ifr}](/extra/tablet)
A FreeCAD model of an existing tablet, the Amazon Fire  7". The model can be used in visualizations.

FreeCAD model of the Playstation 3 Eye camera, which we used in our [Inexpensive Treadmill setup](/inexpensive-treadmill). Potentially useful in visualizations.

[![Heatsink model]({{"/assets/img/Extra/Heatsink/Heatsink_90x90.png"|relative_url}}){:.ifr}](/extra/heatsink)
FreeCAD model of a heatsink we use for our tethering station. Useful for visualization.
