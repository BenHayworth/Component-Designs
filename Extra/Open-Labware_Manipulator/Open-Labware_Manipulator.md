# Open-Labware micromanipulator

The files are OpenSCAD files of the [Open-Labware Micromanipulator](https://open-labware.net/projects/micromanipulator/) from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:239105) and imported into FreeCAD. We initially generated STL files in OpenSCAD. After printing we had some assembly issues and wanted to fix them in the model. Therefore we loaded them into FreeCAD, but then decided to design our own simplified Micromanipulator. All modifications should link back to the Thingiverse model published by BadenLab.

`linearstage.FCStd`: contains all parts for the Open-Labware Micromanipulator. The other 8 files contain the individual parts.
