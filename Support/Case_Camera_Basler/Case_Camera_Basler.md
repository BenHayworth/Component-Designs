## Case_Camera_Basler

This is the back side of a case for a small board camera. It includes a 90Â° screw hole. Designed by Igor Nagrashov at [jET](https://www.janelia.org/support-team/janelia-experimental-technology).

We currently cannot access the original designs in proprietary file formats (`ipt`, `obj`), but printing the `stl` file worked fine. `FCStd` file is an attempt to import the `stl` file in an open-source software, but doesn't allow detailed editing as of now.
