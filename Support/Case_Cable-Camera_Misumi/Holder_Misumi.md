A simple sketch to mount a cable camera (similar to [SYD-V311M5L8-77A](http://www.misumi.com.tw/PLIST.ASP?PC_ID=09)) by the manufacturer MISUMI.

`Case_Cable-Camera.FCStd`: The cable camera has built-in LED illumination in package with a small footprint. This simple case has a 1/4" nut at the bottom, the same thread as normal camera tripods. The pressure mount keeps the camera in place. So far we didn't use the camera because we had some issues with video stream continuity.
