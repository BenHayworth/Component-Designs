# Cooling plate

Original design by Tanya Tabachnik <tt2564@columbia.edu> around June 2011. She was Lead Mechanical Engineer at Janelia by the time.

The cooling plate consists of a body and inlay with the fly sarcophagus. The inlay can be adjusted in its position along the body's slope. To hold the fly in position, a vacuum suction can be attached to the inlay. Both parts are designed to be machined from brass.

Here we provide an assembly files along with the two components:
