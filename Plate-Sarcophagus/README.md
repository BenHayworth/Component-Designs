# Plate-Sarcophagus

Tethering flies to a thing rod requires some practice â€“ and the right equipment. This procedure is typically done under a microscope and with good lighting.

Flies are immobilized by low temperatures, for example by a cold metal plate under the microscope. The temperature of the metal plate is controlled by a peltier element and a temperature sensor. The heat produced by the peltier element is then transported off through a water cooling system with a bath circulator or chiller. 

During the tethering process, flies are held in place by a groove, or sarcophagus, in a small brass block. This small brass block is held in an angled position by a bigger metal body. The smaller block with the groove is machined separately to create different grooves for different applications and animals. The combination of body and block with sarcophagus looks as follows:
