`Inexpensive-Treadmill_Assembly.FCStd`: This file contains all the different parts that we either build for the experimental setup, or that were acquired elsewhere. The `Figures.cam` contains the locations of the camera for generating the images used in the [manuscript about the Inexpensive Treadmill](/Inexpensive-Treadmill).
