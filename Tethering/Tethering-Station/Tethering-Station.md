# Tethering station

The goal of tethering station is to keep the [heatsink and fan](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1335) at an angle, that allows easy access to the flies. For convenience we also wanted to integrate a hand rest and a mount point for a micromanipulator.

`Tethering-Station-v1_acrylic_precut.FCStd`: The initial version of the Tethering Station is designed for the use with a microscope or other type of magnification device (think camera with zoom lens or magnifying lens). It is designed for the heatink and fan package available from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1335) and includes a hand rest as well as the mount point for a micromanipulator with 1" spaced 0.25" screws. All six parts can be cut from flat materials (cast acrylic is a good choice) with a thickness of 0.125" (or 3mm). Although that applies to the base plate as well, we recommend a thicker material for more stability.
