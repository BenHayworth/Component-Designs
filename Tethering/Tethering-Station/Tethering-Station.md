The goal of tethering station is to keep the [heatsink and fan](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1335) at an angle, that allows easy access to the flies. For convenience we also wanted to integrate a hand rest and a mount point for the micromanipulator.

`Tethering-Station_cut_simplified.FCStd`: Based on the conceptual design `Tethering-Station_cut.FCStd`, the simplified file also has interlocks for the individual pieces and cutouts to fasten the parts with screws and nuts. This is specific to certain thickness of the acrylic (about 3mm). If you want to use material of a different thickness, you might want to start your own interlocking from the `Tethering-Station_cut.FCStd` file.

`Tethering-Station_print.FCStd`: We first designed this version, but printing it would have used too much material to be recommended in our [Inexpensive Treadmill manuscript]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill).
