# Cooling plate

Original design by Tanya Tabachnik <tt2564@columbia.edu> around June 2011. She was Lead Mechanical Engineer at Janelia by the time.

The cooling plate consists of a body and inlay with the fly sarcophagus. The inlay can be adjusted in its position along the body's slope. To hold the fly in position, a vacuum suction can be attached to the inlay. Both parts are designed to be machined from brass.

Here we provide an assembly files along with the two components:

- [Colling_Plate-assembly.[pdf|iam]](Cooling_Plate-assembly.pdf) (Part number JF-MR-FS0010)
- [Cooling_Plate-body.[pdf|idw|ipt]](Cooling_Plate-body.pdf) (Part number JF-MR-FS0006)
- [Cooling_Plate-inlay.[pdf|idw|ipt]](Cooling_Plate-inlay.pdf)  (Part number JF-MR-FS0007)

## Alternative file

Melanie Basnak sent us a version in a more accessible file format ([STEP format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21)) in August 2020, also resolving some discrepencies between drawing and model:

- [Cooling_Plate-inlay.[stp|stl]](Cooling_Plate-inlay.stl)
- [Cooling_Plate-body.[stp|stl]](Cooling_Plate-body.stl)
