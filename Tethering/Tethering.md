# Tethering

These components help with body fixating or head fixating flies and potentially other insects.

We use the tethering station in our manuscript about an [Inexpensive Treadmill setup]({{site.baseurl}}/inexpensive-treadmill). The tethering station is designed for a specific heat sink and fan package, has a mount point for our micromanipulator, and has a hand rest that helps with delicate procedure of tethering a fly.

Cylindrical shapes are used to hold the cold-anesthesized animal in place during tethering. The original design dates back to the 1970s, is very flexible, and is machined from brass. An inexpensive alternative that can be used for behavior experiments is our design of the 3D-printed Sarcophagus. Here we share both designs.

Different materials are used for tethering flies. Here we show some desings that can be 3D printed, link to commercially available solutions, and the adapters between these solutions.

[![Fly Plate 5 machined]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Tethering/Flyplate/Flyplate5.png){:.ifr}]({{site.baseurl}}/tether/flyplate)
The flyplate is used in electrophysiology and imaging experiments. The fly head is glued to the plate, which allows dissecting and imaging in head-fixed experiments.
