## Flyplate

The flyplate is used in electrophysiology and imaging experiments. The fly head is glued to the plate, which allows dissecting and imaging in head-fixed experiments.

## Sarcophagus

Cylindrical shapes are used to hold the cold-anesthesized animal in place during tethering. The original design dates back to the 1970s, is very flexible, and is machined from brass. An inexpensive alternative that can be used for behavior experiments is our design of the 3D-printed Sarcophagus.
