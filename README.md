# Design and manufacturing

3D printing and laser cutting designs used in the lab.

`*.scad` files are the native file format of [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/), "The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller". It uses a scripting language to build parametric models.

`*.stl` are "stereolithography" files, containing unstructured triangulated surfaces of 3D models. This is the output format understood by our printers, but not good for editing.

`*.md` with the same basename as other files contain additional information for that file. Usually that's related to licenses etc.


## Holder

Everything related to the tether between fly and robot.

- [Holder-cone_pointy](Holder/Holder-cone_pointy.scad) pointy cone, replaces earlier Holder-cone base design.
- [Holder-cone_pointy_tip-0.07](Holder/Holder-cone_pointy_tip-0.07.scad) additional cylindric tip (0.07mm diameter) on pointy cone.
- [Holder-cone_flat_hole-0.1](Holder/Holder-cone_flat_hole-0.1.scad) cone cut off, instead added a hole (0.1mm diameter) for a metal tether.
- [Holder-cone_flat_hole-0.2](Holder/Holder-cone_flat_hole-0.2.scad) cone cut off, instead added a hole (0.2mm diameter) for a metal tether.


## Camera

Camera related designs.

- [Adapter_PS3-PCB-to-lens-mount.scad](Camera/Adapter_PS3-PCB-to-lens-mount.scad) basic solid that connects to the PCB (the two pins) and can be used to connect to a standard M12 lens holder
- [PS3-lens-mount_M12.scad](Camera/PS3-lens-mount_M12.scad) the adapter from PS3-PCB including the lens mount
