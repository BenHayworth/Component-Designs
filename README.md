# Design and manufacturing

3D printing and laser cutting designs used in the lab.

`*.scad` files are the native file format of [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/), "The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller". It uses a scripting language to build parametric models.

`*.stl` are "stereolithography" files, containing unstructured triangulated surfaces of 3D models. This is the output format understood by our printers, but not good for editing.

`*.md` with the same basename as other files contain additional information for that file. Usually that's related to licenses etc.


## Holder

Everything related to the tether between fly and robot.

- [Holder-cone.scad](Holder/Holder-cone.scad) first attempt to build a 3D-printable holder

## Camera

Camera related designs.

- [Adapter_PS3-PCB-to-lens-mount.scad](Camera/Adapter_PS3-PCB-to-lens-mount.scad) basic solid that connects to the PCB (the two pins) and can be used to connect to a standard M12 lens holder
- [PS3-lens-mount_M12.scad](Camera/PS3-lens-mount_M12.scad) the adapter from PS3-PCB including the lens mount
