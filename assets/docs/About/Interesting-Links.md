## [Open-Labware](https://open-labware.net/)

by *Tom Baden*

A collaboration between the Baden Lab, TReND in Africa, and OpenNeuroscience share a collection of designs and modifications of Open-Source Hardware designs for research labs. Additional documentation is provided in the review ["Open Labware: 3-D Printing Your Own Lab Equipment"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002086).

## [Appropedia: Open-source Lab](https://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab)

by *Joshua Pearce*

The [Open-Source Lab](https://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab) is an initiative by Michigan Tech's Open Sustainability Technology (MOST) Lab, accompanied by the book "Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs" (2013). The MOST Lab maintains several pages on the Appropedia, containing a vast amount of useful information for open-source hardware, developing scientific instruments, and 3D-printing in general. Their [page on 3D-printable science equipment](https://www.appropedia.org/3D_printable_science_equipment) (including sequels [2](https://www.appropedia.org/3D_printable_science_equipment_page_2) and [3](https://www.appropedia.org/3D_printable_science_equipment_page_3)) alone is a useful collection of components for labs. Joshua Pearce also curates a list of [scientific tools on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/jpearce/collections/open-source-scientific-tools).

## [DocuBricks](https://docubricks.com/)

by *Tobias Wenzel* and *Johan Henriksson*

[DocuBricks](https://docubricks.com/) is a site for sharing Open Science Hardware that focuses on detailed and high-quality descriptions of complex setups. The website was created and is maintained by a group of academics at the University of Cambridge. The repository contains few, but useful and thoroughly documented items. In addition, they provide guidelines on how to write a good documentation.

## [NIH 3D Print Exchange](https://3dprint.nih.gov/)

by the US-American *National Insitutes of Health (NIH)*

This [repository](https://3dprint.nih.gov/) focuses on "scientifically accurate or medically applicable" 3D-printable models. This includes a significant amount of molecular models for pedagogy and research, but there is also a section of ["Labware & Devices"](https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover?field_model_category_tag_tid[]=93).

## [A new type of spherical flexure joint based on tetrahedron elements](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precisioneng.2021.03.002)

by *Jelle Rommers and Volkert van der Wijk and Just L. Herder*

**Abstract**: In this paper we present two new designs of spherical flexure joints, which are the compliant equivalent of a
traditional ball-and-socket joint. The designs are formed by tetrahedron-shaped elements, each composed of
three blade flexures with a trapezoidal shape, that are connected in series without intermediate bodies. This is
new with respect to the designs currently found in literature and helps to increase the range of motion. We also
present two planar (x-y-θz ) flexure joint designs which were derived as special versions of the spherical designs.
In these designs the tetrahedron elements have degenerated to a triangular prisms. For detailed investigation we
developed equivalent representations of the tetrahedron and triangular prism elements and proved that three of
the four constraint stiffness terms depend solely on the properties of the main blade flexure. Furthermore, we
derived equations for these stiffness terms which are compared to finite-element simulations, showing a good
correspondence for the prism element with a Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) of 1.9%. For the tetra­
hedron element, the equations showed to only capture the qualitative behaviour with a NMAE of 34.9%. Also, we
derived an equation for the optimal width of the prism element regarding rotational stiffness.

## [Spherical treadmill for mouse VR](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4913066)

preprint by *Tim Schroeder*, *Jan Klee*, *Abdellatif Nemri*, *Martha Havenith*, and *Francesco Battaglia*

**Abstract**: In this design, a 3D-printed base distributes compressed air evenly to support a floating styrofoam ball, while two sensors measure the ball’s rotation speed on 2 axes. It is typically used with virtual reality setups for mouse behavior (Harvey et al. 2009). This open-source project is modified from a design by the Technocenter, Radboud University in collaboration with the Battaglia lab. The original design was adapted to 1) Accommodate the Logitech G502 mouse model (earlier model was discontinued), 2) Distance control – the sensor can be moved closer or away from the styrofoam ball, simply by adding washers between sensor box wall and base. 3) Easy access – The sensor box can be easily open/closed (it attaches with magnets), facilitating cleaning. All sensor components can be removed in that way, giving access to the screws that enable distance control. 4) Easy anchoring on optic tables with 4 feet compatible with M6 screws. This project requires 3D-printed parts (FDM), 2 Logitech G502 mice, a valve and a few screws. See the Assembly Instructions document for a detailed bill of materials and step-by-step instructions.
