# Production

With the help of [jET](https://www.janelia.org/support-team/janelia-experimental-technology), we produce many of the designs in-house and on different printers. On the Formlab printers, we use different types of resins. The Connex uses differnt types of polyjet material. The f170 allows printing of ABS, PLA and similar materials and  we used ABS for all of the f170 prints. Some parts, particularly in the [step-by-step instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-build-inexpensive-treadmill) were replicated on an Ender 3 with PLA. For some results, we document the results in pictures. For those images, the 3D Printer shorthands in the file names stand for:

- form2: [Form 2](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-2/) SLA printer, jET
- form3: [Form 3](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-3/) SLA printer, jET
- connex: [Stratasys Polyjet](https://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/objet-260-500-connex1), jET
- f170: [Stratasys F170](https://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/f123), W2
- ender3: [Creality Ender-3](https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/ender-3-3d-printer) SLA printer, private
