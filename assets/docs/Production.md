# Production

With the help of [jET](https://www.janelia.org/support-team/janelia-experimental-technology), we produce many of the designs in-house and on different printers. On the forms, we use different types of resins. The Connex uses differnt types of polyjet material. The f170 allows printing of ABS, PLA and similar materials.  For some results, we document the results in pictures. For those images, the 3D Printer shorthands in the file names stand for:

- form2: [Form 2](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-2/) SLA printer, jET
- form3: [Form 3](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-3/) SLA printer, jET
- connex: [Statsys Polyjet](https://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/objet-260-500-connex1), jET
- f170: [Stratsys F170](https://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/f123), W2
