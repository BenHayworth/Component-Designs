# Inexpensive Treadmill

![Title page of manuscript]({{"/assets/img/Collection/title.png"|relative_url}}){:.ifr .pop}
"An inexpensive, high-precision, modular spherical treadmill setup optimized for *Drosophila* experiments" is a manuscript Frank Loesche and Michael B. Reiser submitted to the research topic "[Modern Methods in Neuroethology](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/12605/modern-methods-in-neuroethology)" for "[Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience)". We developed a range of new components for this "Inexpensive Treadmill" submission. In this collection we name the components used in the manuscript, refer to their detailed pages, and add information that are outside the scope of a scientific publication.

## Fly Handling

### Funnel

![Funnel 3]({{"/assets/img/Handling/Funnels/Funnel_fly-vial-to-12mm-tube.png"|relative_url}}){:.ifr .pop}
For the experiments in the "Inexpensive Treadmill" manuscript, we used *Drosophila melanogaster* reared in [fly vials](https://flystuff.com/drosophila-products/vials/). These are 95Ã—25mm translucent polypropylene tubes filled with about 20mm of cornmeal based fly food. Before the experiment we transfer a group of flies to a fly vial without food. We [cold anesthetize](https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.098442) the flies, as the chill-coma [rapidly and reversibly immobilizes](https://doi.org/10.1086/320429) the animals. For the "Inexpensive Treadmill", we transfer the flies to [12mm test tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_tube#Biosciences) which we keep on ice for about 5 minutes. For transferring flies between different tubes with 25mm or 12mm diameter, we use a selection of [3D printed funnels]({{site.baseurl}}/handling/funnels).

### Flypicker

![Different suction fly picker]({{"/assets/img/Handling/Flypicker/Flypickers.jpg"|relative_url}}){:.ifr .pop}
To move individual flies, we use so called "fly pickers". With those pen-sized devices we lift flies through suction: a weak partial vacuum inside the device holds the anesthetized fly in place without injuring them. Similar devices are used in microelectronics to place small components during PCB assembly and we have used commercial devices from this industry in the past (top image). For the "Inexpensive Treadmill" we improvised a similar device using a plastic transfer pipette, a few Luer connectors, and either a heat shrink tube (center image) or a one-way tip from a pipette (bottom image). <!-- TODO: add page and description on how to produce this -->
