# Inexpensive Treadmill

![Title page of manuscript]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Collection/title.png){:.ifr .pop}
"An inexpensive, high-precision, modular spherical treadmill setup optimized for *Drosophila* experiments" is a manuscript Frank Loesche and Michael B. Reiser submitted to the research topic "[Modern Methods in Neuroethology](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/12605/modern-methods-in-neuroethology)" for "[Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience)" ([bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.442008v1) at <https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442008>). We developed a range of new components for this "Inexpensive Treadmill" submission. In this collection we name the components used in the manuscript, refer to their detailed pages, and add information that are outside the scope of a scientific publication.

## Fly Handling

### Funnel

![Funnel 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Tethering/Funnels/Funnel_fly-vial-to-12mm-tube.png){:.ifr .pop}
For the experiments in the "Inexpensive Treadmill" manuscript, we used *Drosophila melanogaster* reared in [fly vials](https://flystuff.com/drosophila-products/vials/). These are 95Ã—25mm translucent polypropylene tubes filled with about 20mm of cornmeal based fly food. Before the experiment we transfer a group of flies to a fly vial without food. We [cold anesthetize](https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.098442) the flies, as the chill-coma [rapidly and reversibly immobilizes](https://doi.org/10.1086/320429) the animals. For the "Inexpensive Treadmill", we transfer the flies to [12mm test tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_tube#Biosciences) which we keep on ice for about 5 minutes. For transferring flies between different tubes with 25mm or 12mm diameter, we use a selection of [3D printed funnels]({{site.baseurl}}/tether/funnels).

### Flypicker

![Different suction fly picker]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Tethering/Flypicker/Flypickers.jpg){:.ifr .pop}
To move individual flies, we use so called "fly pickers". With those pen-sized devices we lift flies through suction: a weak partial vacuum inside the device holds the anesthetized fly in place without injuring them. Similar devices are used in microelectronics to place small components during PCB assembly and we have used commercial devices from this industry in the past (top image). For the "Inexpensive Treadmill" we improvised a similar device using a plastic transfer pipette, a few Luer connectors, and either a heat shrink tube (center image) or a one-way tip from a pipette (bottom image). <!-- TODO: add page and description on how to produce this -->

## Tethering Station

We use chill coma to immobilize flies during body-fixation. For the inexpensive treadmill setup, we use an air cooled heat sink with a fan that cools down a small Peltier element. On top of the peltier element we have a cooling plate. A blunt tip dispensing needle, which acts as a tether, is positioned on the thorax of the fly with a micromanipulator.

### Cooling plate with sarcophagi

![cooling plate with 15 differently sized sarcophagi]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Tethering/Sarcophagus/Sarcophagus_platform_15.png){:.ifr .pop}
During tethering flies are held in an upright position by the cylindrical shape of a "sarcophagus". Our current design of the cooling plate has room for 15 different sarcophagi for different insect body sizes and with more or less 3D printed material between the Peltier element and the insect.

### Micro Manipulator

The blunt tip dispensing needle, aka tether, needs to be placed on the fly's thorax at high precision. We achieve fine-graind translational movement of the tether in three dimensions through a 3-axis micro manipulator.

### Hand rest

All elements of the tethering station are held in place by the hand rest. This part is the fancy version of sloping the heat sink by unscrewing two of the screws. It is optional and laser-cut from an acrylic sheet.
